To create this game app, I built upon previously distribute code from the UCD bootcamp module.  Additionally, the MDN and various functionality for CSS, JS, HTML were googled.
Majority credit to the UCD tutors, modules, the internet, specifically the main module04 code, as modifying a native quiz app from scratch is my current level.
